This document compiles various reference materials relevant to this project, such as coding style guidelines, development workflow steps, terminology, and domain-specific mappings (e.g., FIX 4.2 tags).

== Style Guide

This section outlines the coding conventions and documentation standards the team follows.

=== Language and Wording
* **British English** for code comments, doc text, and commit messages.
* Maintain a concise, professional tone. Avoid slang or overly informal expressions.

=== Code Formatting
Indentation :: 4 spaces, no tabs.
Line Length :: Typically 128 characters or fewer if possible.
Braces ::
- Open brace on the same line (`if (condition) {`).
- Close brace on a new line.
Blank Lines ::
- One blank line between method definitions.
- Group related lines logically for readability.

=== Naming Conventions
Classes :: PascalCase (e.g., `OrderService`).
Methods and Variables :: camelCase (e.g., `processOrder`, `userName`).
Constants :: ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES (e.g., `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`).
Packages :: all lowercase, possibly with dots (`com.example.myproject`).

=== Comments and Documentation
* Use Javadoc (`/** ... */`) for public classes/methods, describing purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions.
* Avoid excessive inline comments; code should largely speak for itself.
* Keep commit messages in present tense, referencing issue IDs where relevant.

=== Additional Points
* Some modules rely on `.ad` or `.adoc` files for large code or doc summaries, especially if token constraints apply for AI usage.
* Use xref where possible to link sections in AsciiDoc.

== Workflow

This project embraces an AI-assisted, documentation-first process known as AIDE (Artificial Intelligence Development Environment).

=== Iterative Stages
1. **Document Requirements**
- Write or update `.adoc` content reflecting new features or changes.
- This serves as the “single source of truth.”
2. **Write or Update Tests**
- Create or refine unit, integration, or YAML-based scenario tests, mirroring the documented requirements.
3. **Write or Update Code**
- Let AI or standard IDE tools generate stubs, boilerplate, or scaffolding based on the docs and tests.
- Manually refine logic where needed.
4. **Review**
- AI highlights discrepancies between docs/tests/code. Humans validate correctness.
5. **Repeat**
- Each change in requirements triggers this loop again, keeping everything in sync.

=== Document-First Benefits

Minimal Drift :: Fewer mismatches between code and docs.
Faster Onboarding :: Updated documentation clarifies system design.
Better Quality :: Frequent iteration on specs → more thorough testing.

== FIX 4.2 Mapping

For modules referencing FIX protocol (like the Order Processor), the following table maps relevant fields to standard FIX 4.2 tags. Adjust the table to your actual usage:

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
|FIX Tag |Field/DTO Property |Description
|35=D    |`NewOrderSingle`   |Message type for new orders
|11      |`clOrdID`          |Unique client order ID
|54      |`side`             |Side of the trade (`buy`/`sell`)
|38      |`orderQty`         |Quantity of the order
|44      |`price`            |Price for limit orders
|39      |`ordStatus`        |Order status (e.g., `new`, `filled`)
|150     |`execType`         |Execution type (partial fill, fill, canceled)
|**...** |**(others as needed)**|Expand based on your system’s data
|===

== Additional References

Below are some advanced or miscellaneous notes not covered elsewhere.

=== Large File Summaries
- Certain `.ad` or `.adoc` summaries exist for very large classes or resources that rarely change.
- This practice keeps token usage low for AI processes, while preserving essential context in a succinct form.

=== Performance Insights
- Typical latencies can reach ~1.5µs (shared memory) or ~20µs (TCP) under load.
- For more detailed throughput or latency data, see xref:usage-and-tests.adoc#benchmarks[Usage & Tests → Benchmarking].

=== AI Prompt Templates
- If your build includes scripts or templated prompts for the AI, store them in version control as well.
- Keep track of prompt changes to maintain consistency across feature expansions.

== Closing Notes

Refer back to xref:architecture.adoc[Architecture] for design overviews or xref:usage-and-tests.adoc[Usage & Tests] for instructions on running modules and tests. By maintaining these references, the project stays coherent and approachable to both new and returning contributors.
