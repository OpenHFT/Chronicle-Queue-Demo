/**
 * This package, run.chronicle.routing.out, contains classes related to the output routing functionality.
 * <p>
 * It includes:
 *
 * - SifterImpl: A class implementing the SifterIn interface. This class processes a Value object based on 
 *   whether its 'val' property is an even number or divisible by 3. The processing logic decides how the Value 
 *   object will be routed out.
 * <p>
 * The aim of this package is to provide classes and logic for output operations. This includes taking
 * the processed input data, and routing it to the appropriate channels for further use.
