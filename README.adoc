Sample programs for Chronicle Queue

== Downloading and running sample programs

If you're running Windows, you will need to install the `git` client Cygwin, https://cygwin.com/install.html[here],
with a guide showing installation and packages http://www.mcclean-cooper.com/valentino/cygwin_install/[here].
This allows you to install Linux packages that aren't already on Windows.

When this asks you which packages you want to install, search for and add `git`. This is under `Development` and you need to click `skip` so it says to `install`.
