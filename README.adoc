This is a tutorial demonstrating the usage of Chronicle Queue with simple demo programs.

== Order Processor

You can find the source code for the order processor example [here](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue-Demo/tree/master/order-processor).

== Downloading and Running Sample Programs

If you're running Windows, you will need to install the `git` client and `open-ssh` Cygwin, https://cygwin.com/install.html[here], with a guide showing installation and packages http://www.mcclean-cooper.com/valentino/cygwin_install/[here].
This allows you to install Linux packages that aren't already on Windows.

When this asks you which packages you want to install, search for and add `git`.
This is under `Development` and you need to click `skip` so it says to `install`.

Open IntelliJ or your favorite [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). If you haven't installed an IDE, we recommend [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows), which we'll use for this tutorial.

In IntelliJ, select `Get from VCS` to clone the Chronicle Queue Sample code.

Then, copy the following URL into the `Git Repository URL` field and remember the `Parent Directory`. Click `Clone` to get the code.

If you close the project, you can reopen it by going to `File -> Open`. You'll find the repository in the directory where you saved it.

Now you're ready to run the example programs! You can start with [Simple Input](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue-Demo/tree/master/simple-input).

The second example is [Simple Translator](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue-Demo/tree/master/simple-translator).
