You can find the source code for the order processor example https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue-Demo/tree/master/order-processor[here].

== Downloading and Running Sample Programs

If you're running Windows, you will need to install the `git` client and `open-ssh` Cygwin, https://cygwin.com/install.html[here], with a guide showing installation and packages http://www.mcclean-cooper.com/valentino/cygwin_install/[here].
This allows you to install Linux packages that aren't already on Windows.

When this asks you which packages you want to install, search for and add `git`.
This is under `Development` and you need to click `skip` so it says to `install`.

Open IntelliJ or your favorite https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment[Integrated Development Environment (IDE)]. If you haven't installed an IDE, we recommend https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[IntelliJ], which we'll use for this tutorial.

In IntelliJ, select `Get from VCS` to clone the Chronicle Queue Sample code.

Then, copy the following URL into the `Git Repository URL` field and remember the `Parent Directory`. Click `Clone` to get the code.
