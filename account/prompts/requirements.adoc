== Introduction

This document specifies the functional requirements for an Account Management Service (AMS) that processes account-related commands and generates corresponding events. The AMS is designed to be driven by incoming commands (events) such as account creation, fund transfers, and checkpoint requests. It produces events to indicate success or failure and to provide state snapshots.

== Terminology

*Account*: A financial store of value characterized by an account number, owner name, currency, balance, and an optional overdraft limit.

*Command*: An inbound request to the system (e.g., create an account, transfer funds, request checkpoint). Commands are modelled as Events in this system.

*Event*: An outbound notification from the system that indicates a command's state change, success, or failure.

*Checkpoint*: A request to serialize or snapshot the current state of all accounts for audit or recovery purposes.

== Functional Requirements

=== Account Creation

==== Inputs

1. A `CreateAccount` command containing:

* `sender`: The origin of the command.
* `target`: The intended system (e.g., `vault`).
* `sendingTime`: Holds when the command was sent as a wall clock timestamp with nanosecond resolution.
* `name`: The account holder's name.
* `account`: The numeric identifier for the account (long).
* `currency`: The currency in which the account operates.
* `balance`: The initial balance of the account.
* `overdraft`: The overdraft limit allowed for the account.

The `sendingTime` can be set using `SystemTimeProvider.CLOCK.currentTimeNanos()`.

==== Processing

Upon receiving a `CreateAccount` command:

1. Validate that `target` matches this instance's configured identifier.
2. Validate that `balance` ≥ 0.
3. Validate that the `account` number does not already exist in the system.
4. If validation fails, output a `createAccountFailed` event, including the reason.
5. If validation succeeds:

* Store the account details in a local data structure (e.g., a `Map<Long, CreateAccount>`).
* Emit an `onCreateAccount` event with the stored `CreateAccount` details.

==== Outputs

* `onCreateAccount` event on success:
* `sender`: System ID (e.g., `vault`)
* `target`: The original `sender` of the `CreateAccount` command
* `sendingTime`: The system's current time
* Embedded `createAccount` field containing the original request data.

* `createAccountFailed` event on failure:
* `sender`: System ID (e.g., `vault`)
* `target`: The original `sender` of the `CreateAccount` command
* `sendingTime`: The system's current time
* `reason`: A textual description of the failure (e.g., "invalid balance", "account already exists").

=== Transfer Funds

==== Inputs

1. A `Transfer` command containing:

* `sender`: The origin of the command.
* `target`: The intended system (e.g., `vault`).
* `sendingTime`: Holds when the command was sent as a wall clock timestamp with nanosecond resolution.
* `from`: The source account number.
* `to`: The destination account number.
* `currency`: The currency of the transfer.
* `amount`: The amount to transfer.
* `reference`: A reference field for the reason for the transfer or details.

==== Processing

Upon receiving a `Transfer` command:

1. Validate that `target` matches this instance's identifier.
2. Verify that the `from` account exists and its currency matches the `Transfer.currency`.
3. Verify that the `to` account exists and its currency matches the `Transfer.currency`.
4. Check that the `from` account has sufficient funds (`balance + overdraft ≥ amount`).
5. If validation fails, emit a `transferFailed` event with an appropriate `reason`.
6. If valid, update both accounts:
* Deduct the `amount` from the `from` account's balance.
* Add `amount` to the `to` account's balance.
7. Emit an `onTransfer` event indicating success.

==== Outputs

* `onTransfer` event on success:
* `sender`: System ID (e.g., `vault`)
* `target`: The original `sender` of the `Transfer` command
* `sendingTime`: The system's current time
* Embedded `transfer` field containing the original `Transfer` command data.

* `transferFailed` event on failure:
* `sender`: System ID (e.g., `vault`)
* `target`: The original `sender` of the `Transfer` command
* `sendingTime`: The system's current time
* Embedded `transfer` field containing the original request
* `reason`: A textual description of the failure (e.g., "from account doesn't exist", "insufficient funds").

=== Checkpoint

==== Inputs

1. A `CheckPoint` command containing:
* `sender`: The origin of the command.
* `target`: The intended system (e.g., `vault`).
* `sendingTime`: The timestamp of when the command was sent.

==== Processing

Upon receiving a `CheckPoint` command:

1. Validate that `target` matches this instance's identifier.
2. Emit a `startCheckpoint` event.
3. For every account currently held in the system:
* Emit an `onCreateAccount` event representing its current state.
4. Emit an `endCheckpoint` event.

==== Outputs

* `startCheckpoint` event:
* `sender`: The original `sender` of the `CheckPoint`
* `target`: The system ID (e.g., `vault`)
* `sendingTime`: The system's current time

* A series of `onCreateAccount` events for each known account, reflecting their current state at the time of checkpoint.

* `endCheckpoint` event:
* `sender`: The original `sender` of the `CheckPoint`
* `target`: The system ID (e.g., `vault`)
* `sendingTime`: The system's current time

== Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The system should handle account lookups and updates in O(1) average time via efficient data structures (e.g., HashMap or LinkedHashMap).

2. **Concurrency**: The system may assume single-threaded inputs.

3. **Error Handling**: All invalid or unexpected command conditions result in failure events rather than exceptions visible to callers.

4. **Time Management**: `sendingTime` should be based on a reliable system clock.

== Validation and Testing

To verify these requirements:

1. Send a `createAccount` command with valid parameters and ensure `onCreateAccount` is emitted.
2. Send a `createAccount` command with invalid parameters (e.g., negative balance or duplicate account number) and confirm that `createAccountFailed` is emitted.
3. Perform a valid `transfer` and ensure `onTransfer` is emitted with the updated balances.
4. Attempt invalid transfers and ensure `transferFailed` events are emitted.
5. Issue a `checkPoint` command and validate that `startCheckpoint`, multiple `onCreateAccount` events (one per account), and `endCheckpoint` are produced in order.

== Traceability

Each requirement above directly corresponds to a portion of the Java implementation in `AccountManagerImpl.java`:

* Account creation logic: `createAccount(CreateAccount createAccount)`
* Transfer logic: `transfer(Transfer transfer)`
* Checkpoint logic: `checkPoint(CheckPoint checkPoint)`

Events and conditions are explicitly handled in private utility methods (e.g., `sendCreateAccountFailed`, `sendOnCreateAccount`, `sendTransferFailed`, `sendOnTransfer`).

== Conclusion

This document provides a high-level specification of the required functionalities and expected behaviours of the Account Management Service. Implementing these requirements should align with the Java code structure and produce consistent events for all supported operations.
