You are given a set of requirements and an existing implementation of an Account Management Service (AMS). The AMS processes account-related commands (events) such as account creation, fund transfers, and checkpoint requests, and produces corresponding success/failure events. The code currently meets the basic functional requirements but can be improved for clarity, maintainability, and robustness.

Your task is to improve selected classes in the codebase. Consider the following options and guidelines:

== Guidelines

1. **Adhere to the Provided Requirements**:
The code must continue to fulfill the requirements specified in the `Account Management Service Requirements` document. Any changes should not break the contract defined there.

2. **Validation and Error Handling**:
Assume that the framework validates that DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) before use. Add a comment showing where validation would otherwise occur. If a command is missing critical fields or contains invalid values, handle it gracefully by producing failure events rather than exceptions visible to callers.

3. **Time Management**:
All events should use `SystemTimeProvider.CLOCK.currentTimeNanos()` to set their `sendingTime` fields, ensuring nanosecond-precision wall clock timestamps.

4. **Logging and Comments**:
Add meaningful comments where appropriate to explain the rationale behind certain decisions, especially if the code deviates from typical patterns. Consider using `Jvm.debug()`, `Jvm.warn()`, and `Jvm.error()` for logging. Comments should clarify non-obvious logic, error handling decisions, or performance trade-offs. Do not add comments for trivial logic.

5. **Fluent Interfaces and Deep Copies**:
Preserve the fluent interface style for DTO setters to allow method chaining. When storing new accounts, ensure that `CreateAccount` objects are deep copied before saving them to the internal map, as per the requirements.

6. **Checkpoints and State Serialization**:
During checkpoint processing, ensure that all currently known accounts are emitted as `onCreateAccount` events. Consider how to handle any edge cases (e.g., empty account lists).

7. **Readability and Maintainability**:
Consider extracting common logic (e.g., target checks, currency checks, funds checks) into separate helper methods to reduce code repetition. Make sure your class-level and method-level documentation provides a clear picture of what the code does, why, and how it aligns with the requirements.

== Options to Consider

* Add Javadoc to all classes and their public methods, describing the class’s role, its main responsibilities, and linking it back to the requirements.
* Introduce private helper methods to streamline complex validation or repetitive tasks.
* Use descriptive variable and method names to enhance clarity.
* Check that all failure events include a meaningful `reason` field that matches the requirements.
* Consider adding `@Override` annotations, if missing, to clarify implemented methods from interfaces.
* Add informative comments that explain why certain validations or steps are necessary, rather than just stating what the code does.
* Ensure that the codebase is consistent in its style and adheres to the project’s coding standards.
* Consider how to handle edge cases and exceptional conditions, ensuring that the code behaves predictably and correctly in all scenarios.

== Deliverables

Improve the existing codebase by addressing the guidelines and options provided. Submit the updated classes with the changes you have made, along with a brief summary of the modifications you implemented and why you chose to make them.

== Objective

By following the above guidelines and considering the options, improve the existing codebase to be more robust, understandable, and aligned with the specified requirements. The resulting classes should present a clean, well-documented, and maintainable code structure that clearly communicates their purpose and logic.
