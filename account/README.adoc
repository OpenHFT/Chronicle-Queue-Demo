An event-driven account management system utilising Chronicle libraries for high-performance and low-latency operations. This project demonstrates a reference architecture for creating accounts, performing transfers, and capturing checkpoints of system state, supported by comprehensive testing and benchmarking tools.

This project showcases a low-latency, high-performance account management microservice accessible via TCP or shared memory.
Each inbound and outbound message is persisted in a Chronicle Queue, ensuring durability and traceability.
The system is designed to produce minimal garbage and reduce latency jitter, making it suitable for high-frequency financial operations.

Built on Chronicle Queue and leveraging YAML-based input data, this service uses a fluent interface pattern to handle various account operations, such as account creation, fund transfers, and state checkpoints.
It also includes benchmarking and testing utilities for performance evaluation.

== Key Features

Low Latency :: Designed for microsecond-level response times, especially when using shared memory transport.
High Throughput :: Capable of handling high transaction volumes with minimal garbage production.
Fault Tolerance & Durability :: All messages persist in a Chronicle Queue, aiding recovery and auditability.
Flexible Communication :: Supports TCP and shared memory transport configurations.
Modular Design :: Separates API, DTOs, and implementations for easier maintenance and extension.

== System Overview

=== Core Operations

. **Account Creation**:
Create new accounts with specified details (name, account ID, currency, initial balance, and optional overdraft).

. **Fund Transfers**:
Transfer funds between accounts, validating currencies, balances, and overdrafts.
Produces events indicating success or failure.

. **Checkpointing**:
Emit a snapshot of all accounts' current state at a given time for auditing or recovery.

=== Architecture and Communication

The service can operate in various configurations:

TCP Client to TCP Service :: Offers the most flexibility for distributed deployments, with typical latencies under 20 µs.
TCP Client to Shared Memory Service :: Achieves better performance, typically ~10 µs latency.
Shared Memory Client and Service :: This method achieves the lowest latency, around 1.5 µs for typical operations.

Chronicle Services' `channels` package and Chronicle Queue facilitate fast, low-overhead message passing.
State changes are persistently recorded for replay or state restoration.

== Architecture and Key Components

=== Overview
The system is composed of the following layers:

Input/Output Layer :: Handles external requests (e.g., through Chronicle Channels) and emits responses/events.
Service Layer :: Contains domain services (e.g., `AccountService`) that enforce business rules like account creation, validation, currency checks, and balance updates.
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) :: Represent business events such as `CreateAccount`, `Transfer`, `OnTransfer`, etc. DTOs are validated before processing to ensure data integrity.
Event-Driven Model :: Uses Chronicle’s method readers/writers and queues to handle requests asynchronously and at low latency.
Benchmarking and Testing Tools :: Includes JLBH for microsecond-level latency testing and YAML-driven scenario tests.

=== Key Classes
* `AccountManagerImpl`: Orchestrates incoming events, delegating domain logic to `AccountService` and communicating results back via `AccountManagerOut`.
* `AccountService`: Encapsulates the domain logic for account management (e.g., validating accounts, performing transfers).
* `DTO Classes (CreateAccount, Transfer, OnTransfer, etc.)`: Define the structure and validation rules for events.
* `BenchmarkMain Classes`: Run performance tests and measure end-to-end latencies under various throughput settings.

A typical flow:
1. A request (e.g., `createAccount`) arrives via a Chronicle channel.
2. `AccountManagerImpl` receives the request, delegates validation and business logic to `AccountService`.
3. `AccountService` returns success or a failure reason.
4. `AccountManagerImpl` emits corresponding events (e.g., `onCreateAccount` or `createAccountFailed`).

=== Testability and Benchmarking

A suite of tests and benchmarks (e.g., `AccountManagerBenchmarkMain`) allows easy verification of correctness and performance.
You can measure latency, throughput, and other key metrics to ensure the service meets performance goals.

== Making It Production-Ready with Chronicle Services

To further enhance this solution for production environments, consider using https://chronicle.software/services/[Chronicle Services].
Chronicle Services provides advanced features to ensure high availability, resilience, and smooth operations, including:

Failover Support :: If the primary fails, the system automatically switches to a standby service instance, minimizing downtime.
Process Restarting :: Automatically restart services after unexpected terminations or during scheduled maintenance windows.
Live Upgrades :: Deploy updates without halting the entire system, allowing for rolling upgrades with minimal latency impact.
Idempotent Collections :: Simplify restartable event processing by ensuring operations can be safely replayed without side effects.
Acknowledged Replication :: Achieve high availability and real-time distribution across hosts, ensuring data consistency and durability.
Encryption :: Protect sensitive transaction data with on-disk encryption.
Monitoring & Management :: Gain insights into system performance and health, enabling proactive troubleshooting and optimization.

Integrating Chronicle Services allows your account management microservice to meet strict service-level agreements (SLAs), maintain continuous uptime, and adapt to evolving business and technical requirements.

== Recommended Production Environment

Consider running the service on a server with:

Modern, Fast CPU :: Ensure sufficient but not excessive CPU cores.
High-Performance Storage (NVMe) :: Reduces jitter from IO operations.
Fast Memory :: Memory-intensive operations benefit from faster RAM.
Small Heap Size :: A modest heap (e.g., 2 GB) is sufficient since most data is off-heap.
Tuned Eden Space :: A large Eden space can reduce GC frequency.
For modest volumes, ~1 GB Eden size may suffice.

== Network Layouts

The client and the service can be laid out in various ways without changing the code.

.Ballpark latencies running on a production quality server
|===
| Client Side | Service Side | Typical Latency | 99%ile latency
| TCP | TCP | 20 &micro;s | 25 &micro;s
| TCP | Shared Memory | 10 &micro;s | 13 &micro;s
| Shared Memory | Shared Memory | 1.5 &micro;s | 3 &micro;s
|===

=== Example: TCP Client, TCP Service

This approach offers the most distributed option.
The typical latencies are under 20 &micro;s with the 99%ile latency not much higher.

== Package Structure

We lay out our packages in the following manner

* `api` – Input and output interfaces defining the service contract.
* `dto` – Data Transfer Objects (POJOs) representing commands and events.
* `impl` – The core implementation of the account management logic.
* `util` – Utility classes for low-level operations and helpers.

For demos, we might include `main` classes; however, for a production system, we use a framework https://chronicle.software/services/[Chronicle Services] to handle manageability, monitoring, restart and failover.

== How to Run

. Compile the source files using your preferred Java compiler.
. `AccountManagerServiceMain` runs the end service responsible for holding the state and generating results of transactions
.
. `AccountManagerGatewayMain` acts as a gateway listening for TCP connections and writing to/reading from the shared memory queue the microservices uses

. `AccountManagerClientMain` injects a few simple messages and waits for resulting events from the AccountManagerImpl

`AccountManagerBenchmarkMain` runs a `JLBH` benchmark to report on the latency distribution running on your machine.

== Prerequisites

You need Java 8 or above installed on your machine to run this system.

== Input Data Format

Input data is given in YAML format.
Here's an example of an account creation:

[source,yaml]
----
# Creating an account for Alice with 1000 EUR
createAccount: {
  sender: gw1,
  target: vault,
  sendingTime: 2023-01-20T10:00:00,
  name: alice,
  account: 101013,
  currency: EUR,
  balance: 1000
}
----

And an example of a transfer:

[source,yaml]
----
# Alice sends 10 EUR to Bob
transfer: {
  sender: gw2,
  target: vault,
  sendingTime: 2023-01-20T10:03:00,
  from: 101013,
  to: 101025,
  currency: EUR,
  amount: 10,
  reference: Dog food
}
----

== Limitations and Future Work

This demo does not handle all edge cases and lacks a user-friendly interface.
Future enhancements may include:

* Improved error handling
* Better user interfaces or REST/HTTP endpoints
* More robust fault tolerance and recovery strategies, possibly leveraging Chronicle Services further
