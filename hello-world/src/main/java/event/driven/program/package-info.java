/**
 * This package contains classes and interfaces related to an event-driven programming model.
 * Event-driven programming is a paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events,
 * such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs or threads.
 *
 * <p>Classes in this package may define specific events, listeners, and mechanisms to handle events
 * within an application. Implementations can vary widely depending on the requirements of the system.
