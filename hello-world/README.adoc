= Event-Driven Program Demo
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

This module demonstrates event-driven program development using Chronicle Queue.
It provides a series of small microservices that showcase how to read incoming events (strings), process or transform those events (e.g., by appending an exclamation mark), and then output the results.

== Overview

In this demo, we assume an _event-driven_ architecture with:

* An *input gateway* that reads incoming lines from the console (or another source).
* An *output gateway* that writes lines to the console (or logs them).
* A *microservice* in between that applies any required business logic (e.g., adding an exclamation mark).

The figure above gives a high-level sketch of how these components connect.
This design can be extended to larger, more complex systems with multiple inputs and outputs.

== 1. Implementation Walkthrough

All implementations in this module rely on the same input and output gateways.
Below, we describe each example in detail.

=== 1.1 Input and Output Gateways

The gateways used here are built on the link:../hello-world/src/main/java/event/driven/program/api/Says.java[Says] interface.
* *Input Gateway (`SaysInput`)* reads lines from `System.in` and calls `says.say(line)` for each line.
* *Output Gateway (`SaysOutput`)* receives text via `say(String words)` and prints it to `System.out`.

[source,java]
----
public class SaysInput {
    public static void input(Says says) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        for (String line; ((line = br.readLine()) != null); )
            says.say(line);
    }
}
----
^ Input gateway: reads from the console and invokes `say(...)` on each line.

[source,java]
----
public class SaysOutput implements Says {
    public void say(String words) {
        System.out.println(words);
    }
}
----
^ Output gateway: prints each received message to the console.

=== 1.2 Relaying Input Events to Output

The simplest approach wires the input gateway directly to the output gateway: each incoming line is immediately relayed to the console.
This is implemented in `RecordInputToConsoleMain`.

[source,java]
----
public class RecordInputToConsoleMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Create an output gateway
        final Says says = new SaysOutput();
        // Pass it to the input gateway so that each line is echoed
        SaysInput.input(says);
    }
}
----

When you run `RecordInputToConsoleMain`, each line of input is echoed back:

[source,text]
----
One              // input event
One              // output event
Two              // input event
Two              // output event
Three            // input event
Three            // output event
----

=== 1.3 Logging Input Events as YAML

`RecordInputAsYamlMain` demonstrates how to transform input lines into YAML output.
Chronicle Wire’s `Wires.recordAsYaml` creates a proxy of the `Says` interface that writes method calls in YAML format to a specified `PrintStream`.

[source,java]
----
public class RecordInputAsYamlMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Creates a proxy that logs calls to System.out in YAML format
        final Says says = Wires.recordAsYaml(Says.class, System.out);
        // Reads lines from the console and logs them
        SaysInput.input(says);
    }
}
----

.Run RecordInputAsYamlMain
. Right-click on `RecordInputAsYamlMain` in your IDE.
. Modify run configuration if needed.
. Provide an argument for the input file name (e.g., `says.yaml`), though optional if you only want console logs.

Example console output:
[source,text]
----
One                    // input
say: One               // logged as YAML
...
Two                    // input
say: Two               // logged as YAML
...
Three                  // input
say: Three             // logged as YAML
...
----

=== 1.4 Replaying Logged Outputs from a YAML File

We can replay the recorded YAML lines with `ReplayOutputMain`.
This reads a YAML file (e.g., `says.yaml`) and invokes the `SaysOutput` gateway to print each event.

[source,java]
----
public class ReplayOutputMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // The first argument is the YAML file path
        Wires.replay(args[0], new SaysOutput());
    }
}
----

If your YAML file (`says.yaml`) has lines like:
[source,text]
----
say: One
say: Two
say: Three
...
----
`ReplayOutputMain` prints them out as:

[source,text]
----
One
Two
Three
----

=== 1.5 Adding an Exclamation Mark

`DirectWithExclamationMain` shows how to insert a small piece of logic between reading and printing:
It uses `AddsExclamation` to append `"!"` to each line before passing it to the output gateway.

[source,java]
----
public class DirectWithExclamationMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Decorate the output with an exclamation
        SaysInput.input(new AddsExclamation(new SaysOutput()));
    }
}
----

=== 1.6 The AddsExclamation Microservice

This microservice is a straightforward implementation of `Says`, wrapping another `Says` object:

[source,java]
----
public class AddsExclamation implements Says {
    private final Says out;

    public AddsExclamation(Says out) {
        this.out = out;
    }

    @Override
    public void say(String words) {
        out.say(words + "!");
    }
}
----
When combined with the input and output gateways (e.g., in `DirectWithExclamationMain`), each input line is printed with an exclamation mark:

[source,text]
----
One              // input
One!             // output
Two              // input
Two!             // output
Three            // input
Three!           // output
----

== 2. Testing the Microservice

The link:https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Wire/blob/ea/src/main/java/net/openhft/chronicle/wire/TextMethodTester.java[TextMethodTester] allows you to define input (`in.yaml`) and expected output (`out.yaml`) for your microservice, then compare them automatically.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class AddsExclamationTest {
    @Test
    public void say() throws IOException {
        TextMethodTester<Says> tester = new TextMethodTester<>(
                "says/in.yaml",
                AddsExclamation::new,
                Says.class,
                "says/out.yaml"
        );
        tester.run();
        assertEquals(tester.expected(), tester.actual());
    }
}
----
If the test fails, you can see the difference between expected and actual outputs in your IDE’s comparison viewer.


Running the test should log "Process finished with exit code 0" on the console which shows the test has passed.
Change the second input in in.yaml to Hello World and run the test again, to see the test fails.

== 3. Running the Demo from Maven

Below are common commands for building and running each class:

.Building the code
[source,sh]
mvn clean install

.Run RecordInputToConsoleMain
[source,sh]
mvn install exec:java@RecordInputToConsoleMain

.Run RecordInputAsYamlMain
[source,sh]
mvn install exec:java@RecordInputAsYamlMain -Dexec="says.yaml"

.Run ReplayOutputMain
[source,sh]
mvn install exec:java@ReplayOutputMain

.Run DirectWithExclamationMark
[source,sh]
mvn install exec:java@DirectWithExclamationMark

== Summary

The _hello-world_ example illustrates a simple event-driven pipeline:

* *Read* lines (input gateway).
* *Process* them if needed (e.g., add punctuation).
* *Output* them (console or YAML).

Experiment with each main class:

RecordInputToConsoleMain :: echoes input.
RecordInputAsYamlMain :: logs input as YAML.
ReplayOutputMain :: replays a YAML file.
DirectWithExclamationMain :: adds an exclamation mark.

This small example demonstrates how Chronicle Queue–based code can handle real-time data flow in a concise, modular way.
Once comfortable with these basics, you can explore more advanced modules and features within the repository.
