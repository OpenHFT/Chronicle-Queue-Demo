This guide outlines the core conventions for naming, coding, and documentation. By following these practices, the team maintains clarity, consistency, and a high-quality codebase overall.

== 1. Language and Wording

1. Use **British English** spelling (e.g., `colour`, `initialise`) in code comments, documentation, and commit messages.
2. Maintain a **professional, concise** tone; avoid slang or overly informal expressions.
3. Define all project-specific or domain-specific terms in a link:aide-glossary.adoc[AIDE Glossary].
4. Use straight apostrophes and single and double quotes in code and documentation.
5. Code identifiers may use British or American spellings as needed; consistency within a project is key.
6. When adding suggested improvements to `.adoc` files, use comment syntax like `// consider:`
7. **Document-First Approach**:
* As recommended in the "Next Level AIDE" post, write or update `.adoc` content as early as possible, either in parallel with feature development or before coding (similar to TDD).
* This ensures that the single source of truth is always current and that AI-driven code suggestions align with the actual requirements.

== 2. Directory and Package Structure

1. **Directory Names**: all lowercase; use hyphens or underscores if necessary (e.g., `my-project-utils/`).
2. **File Names**:
* Java: match the class name (e.g., `MyService.java`).
* Documentation: use `.adoc` (e.g., `project-overview.adoc`) with lowercase, hyphenated file names.
* Configuration: `.yaml` or `.properties`, describing purpose (e.g., `app-config.yaml`).
3. **Packages**: all lowercase, reflecting the maven `groupId` and `artifactId` and subsystem (e.g., `groupId.artifactId.service`).

== 3. Java Code Style

=== 3.1 Formatting
1. **Indentation**: 4 spaces; no tabs.
2. **Line Length**: Keep to 128 characters or fewer if possible.
3. **Braces**:
* Open brace on the same line (e.g., `if (condition) {`).
* Close brace on a new line.
4. **Blank Lines**: Separate method definitions with one blank line; group related lines logically.

=== 3.2 Naming Conventions
1. **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `OrderService`).
2. **Methods and Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `processOrder`, `userName`).
3. **Constants**: ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES (e.g., `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`).

=== 3.3 Comments and Documentation
1. Use Javadoc for **public** classes and methods, explaining purpose, parameters, and returns.
2. Only add inline comments (`//`) if the logic isn't apparent.
3. Maintain descriptive commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add new caching layer").

== 4. Testing

=== 4.1 Test Naming Conventions
1. Test classes should be named by appending `Test` to the class they test (e.g., `OrderServiceTest` for `OrderService`).
2. Test method names should describe the test scenario and expected behavior, using camelCase (e.g., `shouldReturnOrderDetailsWhenOrderExists`).

=== 4.2 Directory Structure
1. Mirror the main package structure under `src/test/java/...`.
2. Use a logical grouping of tests, such as:
- Unit tests under `src/test/java`
- Integration tests under `src/integrationTest/java` (if applicable).

=== 4.3 Test Coverage
1. Ensure at least **80% test coverage** for critical business logic.
2. Focus on covering edge cases, particularly for methods with complex branching.
3. Write integration tests for new features or significant architectural changes.

=== 4.4 Writing Effective Tests
1. Each test should focus on a single behavior or scenario.
2. Use parameterized tests for scenarios with repetitive logic.
3. Avoid hardcoding data when reusable fixtures or factories can be applied.

=== 4.5 Mocking and Stubbing
1. Use mocking frameworks (e.g., Mockito) to isolate the unit under test.
2. Stub external dependencies to ensure consistent and repeatable test outcomes.
3. Prefer fakes or in-memory implementations for lightweight data operations (e.g., an in-memory database for integration tests).

=== 4.6 Test Documentation
1. Include comments to clarify the intent of complex test cases.
2. Document preconditions, inputs, and expected outputs within the test itself or in its name.
3. Ensure test cases reference any associated requirements or bug IDs in the comments.

== 5. Documentation (AsciiDoc)
1. Start each `.adoc` file with a title line (`= Title`) and optional metadata.
2. Organise content under headings: `==`, `===`, `====`.
3. Use `[source,java]` blocks (or similar) for code highlighting.
4. Keep lines concise, highlighting key points in bullet lists or admonitions (e.g., `NOTE:`).

== 6. Version Control and Commit Messages
1. Write short, clear commit messages in the **present tense** (e.g., "Fix login bug in UserService").
2. Reference issue IDs if applicable (e.g., "Fix #42: Add advanced search feature").

== 7. Additional Best Practices
1. **AutoCloseable Usage**: Where possible, consider implementing `AutoCloseable` to be used in a try-with-resources block, ensuring deterministic cleanup.
2. **Template Management**: Use templates for AI prompts and text blocks to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

== 8. Summary
By following these concise guidelines—especially consistent, clear Java formatting and straightforward documentation practices—teams ensure a streamlined, maintainable codebase. Remember to evolve this guide as the project grows and needs change.
