== Terms in this Project

* **AIDE**: Artificial Intelligence Development Environment.
* **AsciiDoc**: A lightweight markup language for authoring technical documentation.
* **Context Mode**: The process of generating a `context.asciidoc` file that captures the entire project’s documentation, requirements, and code.
* **Incremental Mode**: The process of generating an `increment.asciidoc` which captures only the newly or recently updated files since the last full `context.asciidoc` build, as described in the “Next Level AIDE” post.
* **Token**: Underlying words or subword units used by AI.
* **Tokens/Line**: A ratio indicating how many tokens appear per non-blank line of text (calculated as total tokens / total lines).
Used as a quick measure of text “density”.
* **Blank Line**: A line containing only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.).

== Different Asciidoctor extensions

Below is a simple table clarifying when to create a shorter `.ad` summary or use a `.asciidoc` file for larger documents.

[cols="1,1,4",options="header"]
|===
| File Type
| Typical Size/Usage
| When to Use

| `.ad`
| Short Summaries
| Generated or manually curated summaries of large docs. Use these when you have huge files that rarely change. Keeps token counts low for AI-based processes without losing essential context.

| `.ad`
| Alt Text for Binary Files
| A description of an image or binary file can be stored in a `.ad` file for inclusion in the `context.asciidoc` file.

| `.adoc.ad`
| Short Summary of an AsciiDoc File
| A short summary of a larger AsciiDoc file that is too large to include in the `context.asciidoc` file.

| `.adoc`
| Medium
| Full documentation files that change relatively often or are critical references. It is useful when your readers or your AI need complete details.

| `.asciidoc`
| Large
| A long-form extension for AsciiDoc files for larger documents that the tools will ignore as too large.
