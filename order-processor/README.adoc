= Order Processor Demo
Peter Lawrey
:lang: en-GB

The Order Processor Demo showcases the implementation of services using messages based on the Financial Information Exchange (FIX) protocol.
This project simulates an order processing system, including features such as creating new orders, cancelling specific orders, and cancelling all orders.
The project is designed to mimic real-world financial trading systems, demonstrating how such a system can be built using Java.

== Requirements

The Order Processor Demo has the following requirements documents:

- link:src/main/adoc/oms-requirements.adoc[OMS Requirements]: This document outlines the requirements for the Order Management System (OMS) in the project.
- link:src/main/adoc/oms-api-requirements.adoc[OMS API Requirements]: This document outlines the requirements for the OMS API in the project.
- link:src/main/adoc/test-requirements.adoc[Test Requirements]: This document outlines the requirements for testing the project.
- link:src/main/adoc/selected-fix-4.2.adoc[Selected FIX 4.2]: This document outlines the selected FIX 4.2 messages and their corresponding DTO classes used in the project.

This project uses link:aide/README.adoc[AIDE] to maintain consistency between requirements, tests, and code.

[#getting-started]
== Getting Started

To get started with the Order Processor Demo, you need to clone the repository to your local machine.
Once you have cloned the repository, you can open it in your IDE of choice (we recommend IntelliJ CE for this project).

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) :: Java 8 Update 202+, Java 11, Java 17, or Java 21
Apache Maven :: Version 3.6.5 or higher
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) :: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (recommended) or any other IDE
Internet Access :: Required for Maven to download necessary dependencies

[#installation]
== Installation

Here are the steps to clone the repository and open it in IntelliJ:

1. Clone the repository with `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Open IntelliJ IDE and select 'Open'
3. Navigate to the cloned repository and click 'Open'
4. Wait for the IDE to import the project and download the necessary dependencies

To run the project, you need to compile the project and run the main classes for different features:

- `OrderAdderMain`: This class simulates the creation of new orders.
- `OrderViewerMain`: This class simulates the viewing of created orders.
- `OrderBenchmarkMain`: This class benchmarks round trip time of writing a `NewOrderSingle` a queue, have the `OMSImpl` produce an `ExecutionReport` and read that report.
- `OMSImpl`: This class handles the processing of the orders, including cancelling orders.

You can run these classes directly from your IDE, or you can use `mvn compile exec:exec@id` on the command line to run the compiled classes.
