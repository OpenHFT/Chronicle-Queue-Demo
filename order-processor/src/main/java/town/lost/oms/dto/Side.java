 * Enumeration for the direction of a trade order.

 * <p>It contains two values: BUY and SELL, which represents the direction of the order. BUY (+1) means the order is to
 * purchase, while SELL (-1) implies the order is to sell.
 *
 * <p>This enumeration can be used to create trading orders, like so:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * NewOrderSingle nos = new NewOrderSingle()
 *    .sender(toLong("sender"))
 *    .target(toLong("target"))
 *    .transactTime(now())
 *    .sendingTime(now())
 *    .orderQty(1)
 *    .ordType(OrderType.MARKET)
 *    .side(Side.BUY)
 *    .symbol(toLong("EURUSD"));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note that the direction is indicated by the {@link Side} used in the 'side' field of the order.
