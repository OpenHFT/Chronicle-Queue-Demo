= Detailed Requirements for Unit Tests and YAML-Based Event-Driven Tests
:doctype: requirements

:lang: en-GB

== Introduction

This document defines **how** we approach testing in this project and the **assumptions** made by the framework.
It covers two main testing layers:

1. **Unit Tests** for individual classes or components (e.g., `OMSImplEdgeCaseTest`).
2. **YAML-Based Event-Driven Tests** for end-to-end scenarios (often referred to as Behavior-Driven Development, or BDD-style tests).

By following these guidelines, we ensure consistency, clarity, and good coverage for all key features and edge cases.

== 1. Overall Testing Goals

1. We aim for **80% or higher coverage** of business logic in critical classes like `OMSImpl`.
2. We must confirm that inbound events (such as `NewOrderSingle` or `CancelOrderRequest`) result in correct outbound messages (`ExecutionReport`, `OrderCancelReject`) or errors (`jvmError(...)`) under normal and exceptional conditions.
3. The tests must be easy to extend and maintain, reflecting changes in the system’s requirements.

== 2. Assumptions Made by the Framework

Several tasks are handled by the broader **event-driven framework**, not directly in the application code.
Specifically:

1. **Validation Calls**:
- The framework calls `dto.validate()` *before* handing an event (like `NewOrderSingle`) to `OMSImpl`.
- The framework calls `validate()` on any outbound message (e.g., `ExecutionReport`) before it is actually persisted to the outbound queue.

2. **Single-Threaded Operation**:
   - The system runs in a single-threaded loop for demonstration purposes. No concurrency issues are tested here.

3. **Exception Handling**:
- If `OMSImpl` throws an unhandled exception, the framework intercepts it and calls `OMSOut.jvmError(...)`.
- This means the `OMSImpl` class itself does not usually handle or catch exceptions directly.

4. **Queue Persistence**:
- All inbound and outbound events are persisted automatically by the framework (Chronicle Queue usage).
- Tests can rely on replay or tailers for verifying message flows.

== 3. Unit Testing Requirements

=== 3.1 Purpose

Unit tests focus on **individual classes** (e.g., `OMSImpl`, utility classes, DTO logic) to ensure correctness in isolation.
We do not require full queue-based flows in these tests; rather, we rely on mocks or stubs for any external interactions.

=== 3.2 Key Requirements

1. **Test Coverage of Edge Cases**
- Negative or zero `orderQty`
- Null or empty strings for mandatory fields
- Invalid enumerations (e.g., unknown `Side`)
- Large numeric values (boundary testing)

2. **Mocking External Interfaces**
- Use a mock of `OMSOut` when testing `OMSImpl`.
- Capture or inspect the outbound messages (like `ExecutionReport`) to verify correctness.

3. **Deterministic Timestamps**
- If `OMSImpl` or related classes generate timestamps or IDs based on time, tests must control or mock the clock (e.g., `SystemTimeProvider.CLOCK`) so the results are repeatable.

4. **Consistent Error and Reject Logic**
- Where relevant, confirm that the correct method (`executionReport` vs. `orderCancelReject` vs. `jvmError`) is called under erroneous conditions.

5. **No Assumed Validation**
   - Even though the framework calls `validate()`, unit tests can optionally explore what happens if a `DTO` with invalid fields reaches `OMSImpl`. This ensures robust handling or clarifies the contract.

=== 3.3 Example Tests

- `OMSImplEdgeCaseTest`
- Confirms how `OMSImpl` processes or rejects invalid `NewOrderSingle`.
- Ensures that “no such order” paths produce `orderCancelReject`.
- Demonstrates correct behavior if exceptions occur in the outbound interface.

== 4. YAML-Based Event-Driven Tests

=== 4.1 Purpose and Structure

These tests simulate **end-to-end** flows:
- *Given* some optional setup in `_setup.yaml` (if needed),
- *When* inbound events are described in `in.yaml`,
- *Then* the system is expected to produce matching events in `out.yaml`.

They are typically used with a runner (e.g., `YamlTester`) that replays the inbound events through `OMSImpl` and verifies the generated output events line-by-line or field-by-field.

=== 4.2 File Organization

*Each test scenario* is typically contained in a directory, e.g.:
- `cancelOrderRequest/`
- `in.yaml`  (describes the request events)
- `out.yaml` (describes the expected system responses)
- `newOrderSingle/`
- `in.yaml`
- `out.yaml`

Additional subdirectories (e.g., `cancelAll`, `newOrderSingleEquity`) handle specialized scenarios.

=== 4.3 Requirements for YAML Scenarios

1. **Scenario Headings**
- Each event block in `in.yaml` and `out.yaml` should have a short heading comment describing what the test block does.

2. **Consistent Field Names and Enum Cases**
- Maintain the same naming conventions (`side: BUY` vs. `SELL` in uppercase, `ordType: MARKET` vs. `LIMIT`).

3. **Timestamps**
- Use consistent date/time formats (e.g., `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS`) and avoid timezones if not needed.

4. **One-to-One Input/Output**
- Each event in `in.yaml` should correspond to exactly one or more events in `out.yaml` (depending on the scenario).
- The test harness compares these systematically to confirm correctness.

5. **Edge Case Coverage**
- Some directories should highlight boundary or invalid data (like missing fields or negative numbers) to confirm the system returns correct `orderCancelReject` or calls `jvmError`.

=== 4.4 Running YAML Tests

1. **YamlTester** picks up each directory listed in `OMSImplTest` (see `paths = Arrays.asList("newOrderSingle", "cancelOrderRequest", ...)`).
2. **in.yaml** events are fed into a new instance of `OMSImpl`.
3. The results are captured and compared against the contents of `out.yaml`.
4. If there is any mismatch, the test fails.

== 5. Additional Considerations

=== 5.1 Single-Threaded Focus

Because this is a demonstration with single-threaded assumptions, concurrency or multi-thread race conditions are out of scope for these tests.
If concurrency were required, we would add specialized integration or load tests.

=== 5.2 Maintaining Requirements Sync

Whenever the code or the domain logic changes:
- Update or add new YAML scenarios demonstrating the revised behavior.
- Update unit tests with new edge cases or coverage.
- Reflect these changes in the AsciiDoc requirements, ensuring that tests remain a **living** specification.

=== 5.3 Future Enhancements

1. **Integration with Chronicle Services**
- For advanced failover or multi-threading, we may create new YAML tests that simulate node crashes or queue replication scenarios.

2. **CI Pipeline**
- We can add steps to lint YAML for syntax errors and to run all tests automatically after each code commit.

== 6. Summary

This document outlines how to structure both **unit tests** and **YAML-based event-driven tests**, ensuring they align with the **framework assumptions** (validation, single-threaded design, exception interception).
By maintaining consistent naming, timestamps, and enumerations, the tests remain clear and consistent with the domain logic.
Each new feature or bug fix should be accompanied by **at least one** new YAML scenario or unit test to preserve coverage and maintain system quality.
