= OMSImpl Functional Requirements (Updated)
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Introduction

The `OMSImpl` class is the core implementation of the `OMSIn` interface, responsible for handling inbound order-related messages and producing appropriate outbound responses.
It serves as the "business logic" portion of the Order Management System (OMS), transforming inbound messages (`NewOrderSingle`, `CancelOrderRequest`, `CancelAll`) into outbound messages (`ExecutionReport`, `OrderCancelReject`).

This component is designed to operate within an **event-driven framework**.
Each inbound event is read from a Chronicle Queue, and each outbound event is written to another Chronicle Queue.
This approach provides *traceability*, as all inbound and outbound events are persisted.

== Purpose and Scope

The primary purposes of `OMSImpl` are:

1. **Receive and Validate** incoming messages (via the framework, which calls `validate()` on DTOs prior to invocation).
2. **Process** inbound messages (e.g., new orders, cancellation requests).
3. **Generate** outbound messages (e.g., execution reports, cancellation rejects).
4. **Publish** outbound events to a Chronicle Queue, after validation via `validate()`.

The scope of `OMSImpl` includes creating new orders, rejecting cancellations, and responding to mass-cancel requests with a single rejection message in this simple example.
State management (e.g., actual order book) is not within the scope of this demonstration.

== Event-Driven Interaction Model

- **Input Events**: Arrive through a Chronicle Queue and are read by a matching method on `OMSImpl` (e.g., `newOrderSingle(...)`).
- **Output Events**: Published to another Chronicle Queue, which downstream consumers or loggers can subscribe to.
- **Traceability**: Because both inbound and outbound events are fully persisted, the system can be audited or replayed.

== Functional Overview

`OMSImpl` implements the following methods from `OMSIn`:

1. `newOrderSingle(NewOrderSingle nos)`
2. `cancelOrderRequest(CancelOrderRequest cor)`
3. `cancelAll(CancelAll cancelAll)`

=== Validation

All inbound DTOs are validated by the framework before calling `OMSImpl`.
Similarly, `OMSImpl` constructs outbound DTOs (e.g., `ExecutionReport`, `OrderCancelReject`), and these are also validated before being written to the Chronicle Queue.
Any validation failure triggers a path where `jvmError` is called or a rejection message is published.

=== newOrderSingle

* **Input**: `NewOrderSingle nos`
- Contains fields such as `symbol`, `orderQty`, `price`, `side`, `clOrdID`, `ordType`, etc.
- Includes metadata (e.g., `sender()`, `target()`, `transactTime()`, `sendingTime()`).

* **Process**:
- A unique `orderID` is generated (in the reference implementation, a nanosecond timestamp).
- An `ExecutionReport` DTO is populated with the relevant data and sent out.
- If the inbound `NewOrderSingle` fails validation (missing fields, invalid values), the system *must* create and send an `OrderCancelReject` instead of an `ExecutionReport`.

* **Output**: `ExecutionReport` (or `OrderCancelReject` if invalid)

=== cancelOrderRequest

* **Input**: `CancelOrderRequest cor`
- Contains fields such as `symbol`, `account`, `origClOrdID`, `clOrdID`, `side`, etc.

* **Process**:
- In this simple reference implementation, no existing orders are tracked, so the request is rejected with `OrderCancelReject` containing the reason `"No such order"`.

* **Output**: `OrderCancelReject`

=== cancelAll

* **Input**: `CancelAll cancelAll`
- Contains fields such as `symbol` and `clOrdID`, representing which orders to cancel.

* **Process**:
- Similar to `cancelOrderRequest`, no orders are tracked.
The system publishes an `OrderCancelReject` with `"No orders to cancel"`.

* **Output**: `OrderCancelReject`

== Error Handling

When an **exception is thrown** during processing (e.g., a validation or runtime error), the event-driven framework captures the exception and calls `OMSOut.jvmError(msg)`.
This ensures system-level errors are tracked in the same queue-based workflow.

== Performance Requirements

- For this simple example, the component **must** be capable of consistently handling **100k messages/second**.
- **99% latency** should remain **low jitter** or better under these throughput conditions, indicating that the system processes most messages quickly and consistently.

== Class Responsibilities

1. **Order Creation**: Creates and populates an `ExecutionReport` from a `NewOrderSingle`.
2. **Order Rejection**: Returns an `OrderCancelReject` for both single-order and mass-cancel requests, or if validation fails.
3. **DTO Mapping**: Maps inbound DTO fields to outbound DTO fields (`sender â†” target`, `symbol`, `clOrdID`, etc.).
4. **Time/ID Generation**: Uses `SystemTimeProvider.CLOCK.currentTimeNanos()` to assign `orderID`.
5. **Validation Flow**: Relies on the framework to call `validate()` on input and output DTOs.
If invalid, the framework or `OMSImpl` triggers appropriate rejection/error handling.

== Sample Implementation

[source,java]
----
public class OMSImpl implements OMSIn {
    private final OMSOut out;
    private final ExecutionReport er = new ExecutionReport();
    private final OrderCancelReject ocr = new OrderCancelReject();

    public OMSImpl(OMSOut out) {
        this.out = out;
    }

    @Override
    public void newOrderSingle(NewOrderSingle nos) {
        // If validated already, proceed; otherwise framework calls jvmError() or triggers rejection
        er.reset();
        long orderID = SystemTimeProvider.CLOCK.currentTimeNanos();

        er.sender(nos.target())
          .target(nos.sender())
          .symbol(nos.symbol())
          .clOrdID(nos.clOrdID())
          .ordType(nos.ordType())
          .orderQty(nos.orderQty())
          .price(nos.price())
          .side(nos.side())
          .sendingTime(nos.sendingTime())
          .transactTime(nos.transactTime())
          .leavesQty(0)
          .cumQty(0)
          .avgPx(0)
          .orderID(orderID)
          .text("Not ready");

        out.executionReport(er);
    }

    @Override
    public void cancelOrderRequest(CancelOrderRequest cor) {
        ocr.reset();
        ocr.sender(cor.target())
           .target(cor.sender())
           .symbol(cor.symbol())
           .clOrdID(cor.clOrdID())
           .sendingTime(cor.sendingTime())
           .reason("No such order");

        out.orderCancelReject(ocr);
    }

    @Override
    public void cancelAll(CancelAll cancelAll) {
        ocr.reset();
        ocr.sender(cancelAll.target())
           .target(cancelAll.sender())
           .symbol(cancelAll.symbol())
           .clOrdID(cancelAll.clOrdID())
           .sendingTime(cancelAll.sendingTime())
           .reason("No orders to cancel");

        out.orderCancelReject(ocr);
    }
}
----

== Execution and Testing

To compile and run a demonstration that uses `OMSImpl` (and other classes in this system), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the source code** for the Order Processor Demo (the project containing `pom.xml` and these source files).
2. **Build the project**:
+
----
mvn clean install
----
3. **Run the relevant main classes**:
+
- `OrderAdderMain` to send `NewOrderSingle` messages.
- `OrderViewerMain` to observe messages in the queue.
- `OMSBenchmarkMain` to measure latency and throughput.

4. **Observe the results**:
- Execution Reports and Order Cancel Rejects appear in the output Chronicle Queue and/or console.

5. **Error Handling**:
- Any exceptions thrown are collected and published by calling `jvmError(msg)` on `OMSOut`.

== Conclusion

The `OMSImpl` class is a simple yet illustrative component in an event-driven OMS framework.
It showcases how to ingest inbound FIX-like messages from a Chronicle Queue, validate them, process the logic (create an `ExecutionReport` or `OrderCancelReject`), and publish results back to a Chronicle Queue.
It must handle 100k msgs/s with low jitter at or better than the 99% latency target.
This design ensures robust traceability, minimal coupling, and a clean separation of inbound versus outbound workflows.
